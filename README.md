# Generic CloudVision Configlet Builder

__WARNING: Because of some internal changes in CVP >= 2022, this repository is not working anymore and will remain visibile in archive mode for information purpose only.__

## Overview

This repository provides a generic [configlet builder](https://www.arista.com/en/cg-cv/cv-creating-configlets#ww1185504) to render a JINJA2 template configured in a configlet and load all datas from a list of static configlets with JSON content.

This configlet works with the following workflow:

- One configlet with Jinja2 template content
- One configlet with JSON data per host. Its name should be something like that: `my-data-configlet$HOSTNAME$` where you can custom `my-data-configlet` string
- An optional list of generic configlet with JSON data to load.

Some example files are available under [examples](examples) folder
